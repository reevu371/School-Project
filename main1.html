   <br><h1>Collection Development <a href="#">[edit]</a></h1>
		<hr>
		<a href="#1.jpg"><img src="1.png"></a>
	<p>Collection development is the systematic planning and rational building of library material. 
	The term includes all activities involved in assessing the users’ needs, evaluating the present collection, 
	determining the selection policy, coordinating the selection of items, 
	re-evaluating and storing parts of the collection and planning for resource sharing. 
	It is not a single activity, but an agglomeration of activities (Parameswaran, 1997). 
	Similarly, <a href="http://www.ala.org/tools/atoz/Collection%20Development/collectiondevelopment">
	ALA Glossary of Library and Information Science (1983)</a> 
	defines collection development as, ” a term which encompasses a number of 
	activities related to the development of the library collection, 
	including the determination and coordination of selection policy, 
	assessment of needs of users and potential users, collection use studies, 
	collection evaluation, identification of collection needs, selection of materials, 
	planning for resources sharing, collection maintenance and weeding” Shipman, 
	(1975) has also defined it as “the sum total of library materials; books, 
	pamphlets, manuscripts, punched cards, serials, government documents, 
	microfiche, and computer tapes, etc. that makes up the holdings of a particular library. 
	In other words, it is planned; systematic development of an already existing collection.”<a href="#">[edit]</a></p>
	
	<br><p>Collection development is a plan which can be implemented and evaluated.<a href="#">[edit]</a> </p>

		<br><p>The process involves three main aspects:<a href="#">[edit]</a></br></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Collection planning- a design to acquire documents.<a href="#">[edit]</a></li>
			<li>Collection implementation process of making documents available.<a href="#">[edit]</a></li>
			<li>Collection evaluation -examining and judging the relevance in relation to goals and objectives.<a href="#">[edit]</a></li>
		</ul>
	
	<br><p>Collection development is actually a blueprint for the maintenance and expansion of the 
	library’s collection in all formats. It is based on a strategic policy which is responsible 
	for selecting materials for the library to understand the philosophy and rationale that guides 
	the development of the collection. With this, the library is able to allocate acquisition funds 
	wisely, shape a strong collection and inform the user community about the nature of the collection. 
	University of Connecticut School of Law (2003) also defines collection development as 
	“It evolved to emphasize the needs of users and to assess their changing attitude towards the collection. 
	Collection development is sometimes considered as synonymous to `collection building’ which means 
	that there is already a nucleus (the central and most important part of an object, movement, or group, 
	forming the basis for its activity and growth) of the collection in the library and the librarian is going 
	to build up the collection”.<a href="#">[edit]</a></p>

	<h2 class="title">Selection Policy<a href="#">[edit]</a></h2>
	<hr>
	<img src="3.jpg">
	<p>Selection policy is intended to implement the general objectives of the library.
	Without a more specific statement of objectives and priorities, such as that 
	provided by a selection policy, the public has no basis for determining the value 
	of what the library is trying to achieve.</p>
	<p>For library professionals to make informed choices, selection policies for all 
	types of libraries — public libraries, academic libraries, technical school libraries, 
	and school libraries (public and private) — should include criteria to guide in the 
	resource selection process. The criteria should be a blend of general, specific, 
	and technical to enable library staff to select materials in all subject areas and formats. 
	In addition to criteria such as appropriateness to the age and level of the user, 
	librarians must also consider creating a collection that reflects diversity of ideas 
	and authors as well as being reflective of the population the library serves.<a href="#">[edit]</a></p>

	<div class="Materials" id="Materials">
	<h2 class="title">Selection of Materials<a href="#">[edit]</a></h2>
	<hr>
	<img src="4.jpg">
	<p>"Selection" refers to the decision that must be made either to add a specific 
	item or types of material to the collection or to retain material already in the collection. 
	It is a means of collection development to meet user needs and does not reflect the opinions 
	or values of the individual selector.</p>
	<p>Typically, the library staff is responsible for selecting materials.  
	This is because the staff is most aware of the needs of the community regarding library materials.  
	In larger libraries, a number of different staff members may have responsibility for selecting materials. 
	In smaller libraries, the director may do all of the selection.  In some school and college libraries, 
	faculty departments may also have some responsibility for selecting materials.  
	However, this needs to be coordinated by the library staff.  Whatever system is used should be 
	clearly defined by the collection development policy.<a href="#">[edit]</a></p>

	<h2 class="title">Collection Maintenance<a href="#">[edit]</a></h2>
	<hr>
	<img src="5.jpg">
	<p>Collection maintenance refers to the daily care of collections: keeping the stacks/storage area neat 
	and clean, performing general housekeeping tasks in the building, and periodically cleaning 
	the collections themselves.</p>
	<p>These activities may differ somewhat from institution to institution. 
	The staff of a public or academic library may need to straighten its shelves daily, 
	while in an archive, staff must ensure that collections are in the right order and 
	returned to the proper storage area. A library with general collections may undertake 
	a cleaning project using student assistants, while a special collections department may 
	contract with a conservator to clean certain materials. The common element in all these activities, 
	however, is the need to continually observe the condition of collections 
	and ensure that they are properly cared for.<a href="#">[edit]</a></p>

	<div class="Weeding" id="Weeding">
	<h2 class="title">Weeding<a href="#">[edit]</a></h2>
	<hr>
	<img src="6.jpg">
	<p>Weeding is the systematic removal of resources from a library based on selected criteria. 
	It is the opposite of selecting material, though the selection and de-selection of material 
	often involve the same thought process. Weeding is a vital process for an active collection 
	because it ensures the collection stays current, relevant, and in good condition. 
	Weeding should be done on a continuous, on-going basis. Educating the staff with workshops 
	and presentations on collection quality, maintenance and the importance and positive benefits 
	of weeding the collection are important components for a library to consider.
	Processes and evaluating individual library materials based on
	established weeding criteria, deciding whether to retain or discard each item, and
	implementing that decision. <a href="#">[edit]</a></p>
